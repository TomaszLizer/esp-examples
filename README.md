# ESP Examples Repository

This repository contains experimentations examples showcasing different features and capabilities of ESP32-C6 microcontrollers.

## Examples

### [HA_led_and_button](./HA_led_and_button/)
**Combined Zigbee Light and Switch Example**

A single-board implementation that combines both Home Automation On/Off Light and On/Off Switch functionalities on one Zigbee end device. This example demonstrates **Dual endpoint architecture**: Light endpoint (receives commands) + Switch endpoint (sends commands)

## Getting Started

Each example includes its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions. Make sure you have:

- ESP-IDF development framework installed
- ESP-Zigbee-SDK for Zigbee examples
- Compatible ESP development board (ESP32-C6, ESP32-H2, or ESP32-C5)

## Contributing

This is a personal experimentation repository. Feel free to explore the code and use it as reference for your own ESP projects.
